\section{Cluster Symplectic Groupoids}
In this section we give an integration to a symplectic groupoid $\cG(\Sigma)$ of the Poisson structure on a cluster manifold $M(\Sigma)$.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Totally Positive Cluster Manifolds}
In this section we show that the totally nonnegative part $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ of a cluster manifold is a manifold with corners in the sense of \cite{Joyce?}.  
Moreover, we show that the nonnegative cluster manifold is a union of symplectic leaves for any compatible Poisson structure on $\cA(\Sigma)$.  
Here there is a unique dense symplectic leaf and the boundary of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ is again a union of symplectic leaves of lower dimension where the Poisson structure degenerates.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a seed.  
  The 1-skeleton of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ given by 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional symplectic leaves identifies with the exchange graph of $\cA(\Sigma)$.  
  Moreover, if $\Sigma$ is a seed of finite-type, then $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ provides a realization of the generalized associahedron with the same Cartan type as $\Sigma$.
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Symplectic Topology of the Nonnegative Cluster Groupoid}
Let $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ denote the symplectic groupoid over $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$.  
In this section we introduce a Poisson spray which may be used to construct $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ and apply a Moser argument to show that up to symplectomorphism $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ can be identified with $T^*M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$.
