  We prove some things.
  And we are happy!
  It seems to work!

\maketitle
Outline
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Intro to Poisson manifolds, symplectic groupoid and Poisson spray
	\item Intro to cluster algebra and compatible Poisson structures 
	\item Cluster symplectic groupoid
	\item Totally positive cluster manifolds (definition of manifolds with corners [check D Joyce], associahedron of type A and generalized associahedron)
