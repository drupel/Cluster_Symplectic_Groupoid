\section{Poisson Geometry}
In this section we recall the various definitions of Poisson manifolds and the construction of symplectic groupoids from the Poisson spray \cite{MR2900786}.

\begin{definition}
A smooth Poisson manifold is a smooth manifold $M$ equipped with one of the following three equivalent structures:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item A Lie bracket (called a Poisson bracket)
			$$
				\{\cdot, \cdot\}: C^\infty(M) \times C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(M)
			$$
				satisfying the Leibniz rule
			$$
				\{fg, h\} = f\{g,h\} + g\{f,h\}
			$$
			is satisfied. 
		\item A Poisson bivector $\pi \in \mathfrak{X}^2(M)$ such that $[\pi, \pi] = 0$ where
			$$
				[\cdot, \cdot]: \mathfrak{X}^p(M) \times \mathfrak{X}^q(M) \to \mathfrak{X}^{p+q-1}(M)
			$$
			is the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket.
		\item A Poisson differental operator $d_\pi: \mathfrak{X}^p(M) \to \mathfrak{X}^{p+1}(M)$ with $d_\pi^2 = 0$.
\end{enumerate}	
	A holomorphic Poisson manifold is analogous where $M$ is a holomorphic manifold.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	We shall denote a Poisson manifold by either $(M, \pi)$ or $(M, \{,\})$.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Poisson bivector is related to the Poisson bracket by the following formula: $\{f, g\} = \pi (df \otimes dg)$, for $f, g\in C^\infty(M)$.
		\item The Poisson differential operator is related to the Poisson bivector by the following formula: $d_\pi X = [\pi, X]$ for $X \in \mathfrak{X}^p(M)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

The notion of the symplectic groupoid of a Poisson manifold was introduced independently by Weinstein \cite{MR866024}, Karas\"{e}v \cite{MR1008479} and Zakrzewski \cite{MR1081010, MR1081011}. It is closely related to Poisson sigma models \cite{MR1938552} and quantization \cite{MR2417440}. As a Lie groupoid, the symplectic groupoid integrates the Poisson Lie algebroid $\pi^\sharp: T^*M \to TM$ \cite{MR866024}.

\begin{definition}
A groupoid $G \rightrightarrows M$ consists of two sets $G$ and $M$ with the following maps:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item a surjective source map $\alpha: G \to M$ and a surjective target map $\beta: G \to M$;
		\item an injective identity map $\mathtt{1}: M \to G, \enskip x \mapsto \mathtt{1}_x$;
		\item a multiplication map $m: G {_\beta \times_\alpha} G \to G, \enskip (g, h) \mapsto gh$;
		\item and an involutive inversion map $i: G \to G, \enskip g \mapsto g^{-1}$
	\end{enumerate}
that satisfies the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\alpha(\mathtt{1}_x) = \beta(\mathtt{1}_x) = x$;
		\item $\alpha(gh) = \alpha(g), \enskip \beta(gh) = \beta(h)$;
		\item $\alpha(g^{-1}) = \beta(g), \enskip \beta(g^{-1}) = \alpha(g)$;
		\item $(\mathtt{1}_x)^{-1} = \mathtt{1}_x$.
	\end{enumerate}
A Lie groupoid $G \rightrightarrows M$ has the addtional properties as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $G$ and $M$ are smooth manifolds;
		\item the source $\alpha: G \to M$ and the target $\beta: G \to M$ are surjective submersions;
		\item the multiplication map $m: G {_\beta \times_\alpha} G \to G$ is smooth;
		\item the inversion map $i: G \to G$ is smooth.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
For a Poisson manifold $(M, \pi)$, a symplectic groupoid is a symplectic manifold $(G, \omega)$ with a Lie groupoid structure $G \rightrightarrows M$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the source $\alpha: (G, \omega) \to (M, \pi)$ and the target $\beta: (G, \omega) \to (M, \pi)$ are Poisson maps;
		\item the graph of the multiplication map $\Gamma_m = \{(g, h, gh) \in G \times G \times G\}$ is a Lagrangian submanifold of $(G \times G \times G, \omega \oplus \omega \oplus -\omega)$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The problem of existence of symplectic groupoids given a Poisson manifold, or more generally the existence of Lie groupoids given a Lie algebroid, was solved by Crainic-Fernandes \cite{MR1973056, MR2128714}. There are a few notable examples of symplectic groupoids, e.g. the symplectic double of Poisson Lie groups \cite{MR2128714} and the blow-up construction of log symplectic manifolds \cite{MR3214314}, but in general it is difficult to find explicit examples of symplectic groupoids. There is, however, a local construction of symplectic groupoids by Crainic-Marcut \cite{MR2900786} and Cabrera-Marcut-Salazar \cite{CMS17}, which utilizing the notion of Poisson sprays.

\begin{definition}
For a Poisson manifold $(M, \pi)$, a Poisson spray is a vector field $X \in \mathfrak{X}(T^*M)$ is a Poisson spray if
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item for $(x,p) \in T^*M$,
			$$
				(\tau_M)_*\left(X_{(x,p)} \right) = \pi^\flat(p)
			$$
			where $(\tau_M): T^*M \to M$ is the projection;
		\item
			$X$ is homogeneous of degree 1, i.e.
			$$
				(m_\lambda)_*(X) = \lambda X 
			$$
			where $m_\lambda: T^*M \to T^*M, \enskip (x,p) \mapsto (x,\lambda p)$ is the fiberwise scaling map.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} \cite{MR2900786, CMS17} \label{thm:poissp}
For a Poisson manifold $(M, \pi)$ with a Poisson spray $X \in \mathfrak{X}(T^*M)$, a neighbourhood $U$ of the zero section of $T^*M$ is a local symplectic groupoid over $(M, \pi)$ with the following structures:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the source map $\alpha = \tau_M: U \to M$ is the bundle projection ;
		\item the target map is
			$$
				\beta: U \to M, \qquad \beta = \tau_M \circ \varphi_X^1
			$$
		where $\varphi_X^1: T^*M \to T^*M$ is the time-$1$-flow of the Poisson spray $X$;
		\item the multiplication is the concatenation of the flow of $X$; and
		\item the symplectic form on $U$ is
			$$
				\overline{\omega} = \int_{0}^{1} (\varphi_X^s)^*\omega_0 ds.
			$$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	By local symplectic groupoid $G \rightrightarrows M$, we mean that the multiplication $m: G {_\beta \times_\alpha} G \to G$ may not be defined on the entirety of its domain, e.g. in this particular case the time-$1$-flow of the Poisson spray $X$ may be outside the neighbourhood $U$.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
	Given a Poisson spray $X \in \mathfrak{X}(T^*M)$ on a Poisson manifold $(M, \pi)$, there is actually a 1-parameter family of local symplectic groupoid structure on a neighourhood $U$ of the zero section of $T^*M$ with the following structures:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item the source map $\alpha = \tau_M: U \to M$ is the bundle projection ;
		\item the target map is
			$$
				\beta: U \to M, \qquad \beta = \tau_M \circ \varphi_X^t
			$$
		where $\varphi_X^t: T^*M \to T^*M$ is the time-$t$-flow of the Poisson spray $X$;
		\item the multiplication is the concatenation of the time-$t$-flow of $X$; and
		\item the symplectic form on $U$ is
			$$
				\overline{\omega}_t = \frac{1}{t}\int_{0}^{t} (\varphi_X^s)^*\omega_0 ds.
			$$
	\end{enumerate}
The local symplectic groupoid $(U, \overline{\omega}_t)$ integrates the Poisson manifold $(M, t\pi)$ for $0 \leq t\leq 1$. In particular, the local symplectic groupoid in Theorem~\ref{thm:poissp} is the case $t = 1$.
\end{remark}

In local coordinates $T^*\mathbb{R}^n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n, p_1, \ldots, p_n)\}$, if the Poisson structure
$$
	\pi = \sum_{i > j} \pi_{ij} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \wedge \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j},
$$
then a Poisson spray is of the form
$$
	X = \sum_{i > j} \pi_{ij} p_i \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j} - \sum_{i > j} \pi_{ij} p_j \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} + \sum_i f_i \frac{\partial}{\partial p_i}
$$
where $f_i$'s are fiberwise quadratic functions on $T^*\mathbb{R}^n$.

\section{Cluster Algebras}

Let $\tilde B=(b_{ij})$ be an $m\times n$ integer matrix with $m\ge n$.  
Write $B$ for the upper $n\times n$ submatrix of $\tilde B$ and assume $B$ is skew-symmetrizable, i.e. there exists an integer diagonal matrix $D=\diag(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ with each $d_i>0$ so that $DB$ is skew-symmetric. 
We call such a matrix $\tilde B$ an $m\times n$ \emph{exchange matrix}.
For $1\le k\le n$, define the \emph{mutation of $\tilde B$ in direction $k$} by $\mu_k\tilde B=(b'_{ij})$ where
\[b'_{ij}=\begin{cases}-b_{ij} & \text{if $i=k$ or $j=k$;}\\ b_{ij}+[b_{ik}]_+b_{kj}+b_{ik}[-b_{kj}]_+ & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\]
Above we used the notation $[b]_+=\max\{b,0\}$.

Let $\cF$ be an extension field of $\QQ$ of transcendence degree $m$.   
A \emph{seed} in $\cF$ is a pair $\Sigma=(\bfx,\tilde B)$ where $\bfx=(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$ is a transendence basis of $\cF$ over $\QQ$ called the \emph{cluster} with entries called \emph{cluster variables} and $\tilde B$ is an $m\times n$ exchange matrix.
For $1\le k\le n$, define the \emph{mutation of $\Sigma$ in direction $k$} by $\mu_k\Sigma=(\bfx',\mu_k\tilde B)$ where 
\[\bfx'=(x'_1,\ldots,x'_m),\qquad x'_i=\begin{cases} x_i & \text{if $i\ne k$;}\\ \frac{1}{x_k}\left(\prod\limits_{i=1}^m x_i^{[b_{ik}]_+}+\prod\limits_{i=1}^m x_i^{[-b_{ik}]_+}\right) & \text{if $i=k$.}\end{cases}\]
Observe that seed mutation is involutive, i.e. $\mu_k\mu_k\Sigma=\Sigma$.
A seed $\Sigma'$ is \emph{mutation equivalent} to $\Sigma$ if there exists a sequence of mutations which transforms $\Sigma$ into $\Sigma'$, in this case we write $\Sigma'\sim\Sigma$.
\begin{definition}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a seed in $\cF$.  The \emph{cluster algebra} is the $\ZZ$-subalgebra of $\cF$ generated by all cluster variables from seeds $\Sigma'$ mutation equivalent to $\Sigma$.
\end{definition}
By iterating the exchange relations we appear to get elements of $\QQ(x_1,\ldots,x_m)\subset\cF$, that is rational functions in $x_1,\ldots,x_m$.  
The following result of Fomin and Zelevinsky known as ``the Laurent phenomenon'' shows that the cluster variables always take on a much simpler form.
\begin{theorem}\cite{fomin-zelevinsky1}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a seed in $\cF$ and $\Sigma'\sim\Sigma$.  Each cluster variable $x'_i$ of $\Sigma'$ is an element of the subring $\ZZ[x_1^{\pm1},\ldots,x_m^{\pm1}]\subset\cF$.
\end{theorem}

In fact, the situtation is even nicer: the initial cluster Laurent expansions of all cluster variables have positive integer coefficients.
\begin{theorem}\cite{lee-schiffler, gross-hacking-keel-kontsevich}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a seed in $\cF$ and $\Sigma'\sim\Sigma$.  Each cluster variable $x'_i$ of $\Sigma'$ is an element of the subsemiring $\ZZ_{\ge0}[x_1^{\pm1},\ldots,x_m^{\pm1}]\subset\cF$. 
\end{theorem}

\section{Cluster Symplectic Groupoids}
In this section we give an integration to a symplectic groupoid $\cG(\Sigma)$ of the Poisson structure on a cluster manifold $M(\Sigma)$.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Totally Positive Cluster Manifolds}
In this section we show that the totally nonnegative part $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ of a cluster manifold is a manifold with corners in the sense of \cite{MR3077259}.  
Moreover, we show that the nonnegative cluster manifold is a union of symplectic leaves for any compatible Poisson structure on $\cA(\Sigma)$.  
The symplectic leaves of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ are naturally labelled by compatible subsets of cluster variables, where the number of cluster variables in the labeling set determines the corank of the symplectic leaf.
Here there is a unique dense symplectic leaf and the boundary of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ is again a union of symplectic leaves of lower dimension where the Poisson structure degenerates.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\Sigma$ be a seed.  
  The 1-skeleton of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ given by 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional symplectic leaves identifies with the exchange graph of $\cA(\Sigma)$.  
  Moreover, if $\Sigma$ is a seed of finite-type, then $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ provides a realization of the generalized associahedron with the same Cartan type as $\Sigma$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The 0-dimensional symplectic leaves correspond to the vanishing of all cluster variables from a seed mutation equivalent to $\Sigma$.  
  Then a 1-dimensional symplectic leaf whose boundaries correspond to seeds $\Sigma'$ and $\Sigma''$ exactly corresponds to the non-vanishing of exchangable cluster variables $x'_k$ and $x''_k$.
  But this is exactly the exchange graph of $\cA(\Sigma)$.

  When $\Sigma$ is of finite-type, the realization of $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ as a simplicial complex, given by taking symplectic leaves as cells, is naturally dual to the cluster complex of $\cA(\Sigma)$, i.e. $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ identifies with the associated generalized associahedron.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Symplectic Topology of the Nonnegative Cluster Groupoid}
Let $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ denote the symplectic groupoid over $M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$.  
In this section we introduce a Poisson spray which may be used to construct $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ and apply a Moser argument to show that up to symplectomorphism $\cG_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$ can be identified with $T^*M_{\ge0}(\Sigma)$.
